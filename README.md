## Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern is probably the most infamous pattern to exist, and is considered an anti-pattern because it creates global variables that can be accessed and changed from anywhere in the code.

Yet, The use of the singleton pattern is justified in those cases where we want to restrict the number of instances that we create from a class in order to save the system resources. Such cases include data base connections as well as external APIs that devour our system resources.
